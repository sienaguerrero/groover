This was built by [Teresa Ibarra](https://github.com/teresaibarra), [Siena Guerrero](https://github.com/sienaguerrero), [Jocelyn Chen](https://github.com/jocelynyhc), [Trevor Walker](https://github.com/trevor-walker32), and [Walker Quinn](https://github.com/wsquinn) for Harvey Mudd's [Software Development](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/program/course-descriptions/) course. See it running live [here](http://www.groovermusic.net).

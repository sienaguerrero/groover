# Groover ðŸŽµ

## About
Groover is an application that neurally generates music recommendations based on a song's lyrics. This was built by [Teresa Ibarra](https://github.com/teresaibarra), [Siena Guerrero](https://github.com/sienaguerrero), [Jocelyn Chen](https://github.com/jocelynyhc), [Trevor Walker](https://github.com/trevor-walker32), and [Walker Quinn](https://github.com/wsquinn) for Harvey Mudd's [Software Development](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/program/course-descriptions/) course. See it running live [here](http://www.groovermusic.net).


## Running Locally
To run this locally, first `pip install flask_wtf`, then `cd` into your project directory and  run `virtualenv venv` (you only have to do this once per install), `source venv/bin/activate`, and `pip install -r requirements.txt`. 

You should set your environment variables and API keys in `.env`. `.env` should also include 'FLASK_APP = groover.py'. You will need API keys for MUSIX_API_KEY, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID, and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET. 

When you're ready, run `flask run`.
